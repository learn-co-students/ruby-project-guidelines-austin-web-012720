# YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO
## By Franco Canedo and Jelena Stjepanovic

  Your stock portfolio is a command line interface app where the user can manage their own stock portfolio.

  ### Instructions
  Once the app is initialized, a user can do the following things:
  - Create account or log in to an existing account.
  - Once an account is created, a user can look up a stock, buy or sell stock, view most popular stock, or log out. 
  - As an added functionality, user can access his/her portfolio page, containing all the information of the stocks they own. 
  - Within the portfolio page, a menu allows user to buy and sell stock, get stock earnings, get analyst recommendations, and get back to main menu. 
  - Also within a porfolio page, a user can view their watchlist, which will have options to add and remove stock from the watchlist, as well as add notes.
